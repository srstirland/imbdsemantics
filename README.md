# imbdsemantics
Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 

So it makes sense on the webpage.

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 

So we can understand the code as well as re-use it for things!

What are some disadvantages? 

Lack of creativity. Maybe it wasn't done the best way but we are still using it that way.
